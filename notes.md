- Why anti cloud
  - Stuff breaks when cloud goes down
  - Lackluster attention to security
  - Limited functionality / interoperability
  - Bad user experience
- Why local
  - Automation is better than control
    - Motion sensors to turn on lights
  - Smart automations beat dumb automations
    - Motion controlled lights turn off when you want them on and vice versa
    - Smart automations can be context aware
  - Don't care what happens to someone else's computers/internet
  - Works for other people too, not just me
- Need 3 things
  - Hubs
    - The brain
  - Protocols
    - How the brains talks to stuff
    - Options
      - Wi-Fi
        - No standard for local control
          - Some devices have local apis but rarely documented
        - Every device needs separate app
        - Apps depend on cloud and can be insecure
      - Zigbee
        - Lower cost
        - Wi-Fi interference
        - Interop issues
        - Need radio/transmitter
      - Zwave
        - Higher cost
        - Robust and reliable
        - Need radio/transmitter
      - Matter
        - Not ready for prime time yet
        - Requires a thread border router
          - Lots of Google, Amazon, and Apple devices have this built in
    - Can mix and match
  - Devices 
    - Wi-Fi protocol devices can break if update is pushed because API isn't designed for third party
